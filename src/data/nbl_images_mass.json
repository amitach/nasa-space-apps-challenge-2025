Navy divers, Air Force pararescuemen and Coast Guard rescue swimmers are preparing to practice Orion underway recovery techniques with a test version of the Orion spacecraft. Training will help the team prepare for Underway Recovery Test 5 for Exploration Mission 1 aboard the USS San Diego in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California in October. The Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, along with the U.S. Navy and Lockheed Martin, are preparing the recovery team, hardware and operations to support EM-1 recovery.",

This testing and evaluation involved turning off all the lights in the facility, installing black curtains on the pool walls to minimize reflections, and using a powerful underwater cinematic lamp, to get the conditions just right ahead of upcoming training for astronauts.",

    "description": "JSC2000-07391 (1 December 2000)--- Astronaut Chris A. Hadfield, representing the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), puts final touches on the suit-up process in preparation for a training session in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) near the Johnson Space Center (JSC).  Hadfield is designated for space walk duty on the STS-100 flight, and underwater simulations of his duties help prepare him for the mission, scheduled for spring of next year.  By coincidence, Hadfield is aligned beneath the Canadian flag, one of the many on NBL walls which pay tribute to the participating international partners.",

The giant pool in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL)at the Sonny Carter Training Facility allows the STS-95 crewmembers the opportunity to simulate ejection from an aircraft over water. A number of SCUBA-equipped divers assist in the training exercises.

Parachute drops, raft deployment, water bailing, flare signaling and other survival techniques are also covered in the session.",

The two assigned space walkers -- Newman and Jerry L. Ross -- shared the platform as it was lowered into the water where the pair moments later were training with full-scale mockups of the International Space Station (ISS) hardware with which they'll be working in space.  One of those elements will be the Functional Cargo Block (FGB), which will have been launched a couple of weeks prior to STS-88.  Once the FGB is captured using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, astronaut Nancy J. Currie, mission specialist, will maneuver the robot arm to dock the FGB to the conical mating adapter at the top of Node 1, to be carried in the Space Shuttle's cargo bay.  In ensuing days, three Extravehicular Activity?s (EVA) by Ross and Newman will be performed to make power, data and utility connections between the two modules.",
