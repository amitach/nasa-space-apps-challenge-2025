The image shows the coast of Algeria featuring (in the Cupola?s round window) an area between the cities of Dellys and Algiers. The image was recorded with a digital still camera using a 28mm lens setting. The Cupola, which a week and half ago was brought up to the orbital outpost by the STS-130 crew on the space shuttle Endeavour, will house controls for the station robotics and will be a location where crew members can operate the robotic arms and monitor other exterior activities.",

The Cupola, delivered to the International Space Station by Endeavour on STS-130, frames various images that represent the processing and execution of the Space Shuttle Program. Clockwise from top, are the first-ever use of a drag chute during the STS-49 landing, rollout to a launch pad, a ferry flight return to Kennedy, rolling into an orbiter processing facility, docking to the International Space Station, and lifting operations before being mated to an external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters in the Vehicle Assembly Building. The background image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and signifies the first shuttle servicing mission, which was performed by Endeavour's STS-61 crew. Crew-designed patches from Endeavour\u2019s maiden voyage through its final mission are shown ascending toward the stars.

The brightly lit core of the Liege urban area appears to lie at the center of a network of roadways\u2014traceable by continuous orange lighting\u2014extending outwards into the rural, and relatively dark, Belgium countryside. For a sense of scale the distance from left to right is approximately 70 kilometers. The region at upper left to the southeast of Verviers includes agricultural fields and forest; hence it appears almost uniformly dark at night. The image was taken using the European Space Agency\u2019s Nodding mechanism, also known as the NightPod. NightPod is an electro-mechanical mount system designed to compensate digital cameras for the motion of the space station relative to Earth. The primary mission goal was to take high-resolution, long exposure digital imagery of Earth from the station\u2019s Cupola, particularly cities at night. While the official NightPod mission has been completed, the mechanism remains onboard for crew members to use. Liege is the third most populous metropolitan region in Belgium (after Brussels and Antwerp); it includes 52 municipalities, including the nearby city of Seraing.",

The Cupola, delivered to the International Space Station by Endeavour on STS-130, frames various images that represent the processing and execution of the Space Shuttle Program. Clockwise from top, are the first-ever use of a drag chute during the STS-49 landing, rollout to a launch pad, a ferry flight return to Kennedy, rolling into an orbiter processing facility, docking to the International Space Station, and lifting operations before being mated to an external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters in the Vehicle Assembly Building. The background image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and signifies the first shuttle servicing mission, which was performed by Endeavour's STS-61 crew.

    "description": "ISS031-E-089012 (5 June 2012) --- Transit of Venus across the sun observed from the International Space Station on June 5, 2012. Observations of the transit of Venus during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries allowed scientists to calculate the distance between Earth and the sun, as well as providing insight into the existence of Venus\u2019 atmosphere. Since the previous pair of transits of Venus occurred in 1874 and 1882, humanity developed the ability to view the phenomena from space \u2013 both directly from low Earth orbit, and remotely from sensors on spacecraft collecting scientific data about the sun. NASA astronaut Don Pettit, Expedition 31 flight engineer, was particularly keen to take imagery of the event from the orbital perspective \u2013 even bringing a solar camera filter aboard for the event. This image, taken during the first half of the 2012 transit, is one of hundreds of the event taken from the space station Cupola, a windowed module that provides the crew unparalleled views of both Earth and astronomical phenomena. In fact, history will record the station as the first orbital, crewed spacecraft from which the transit of Venus was observed. In addition to the dark circle of Venus visible at lower right, several smaller sunspots visible at center. The transit of Venus across the sun is one of only two such planetary crossings\u2014the other being the transit of Mercury\u2014that are visible from Earth. While transits of Mercury occur 13 times each century, Venus is observed to transit the sun only twice over the same time period (the first transit of the current pair occurred in 2004). Unless you are fortunate enough to be at locations on Earth where the transit is visible both times, this makes the transit of Venus a true \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d event.",
